Using Skiena's strong.c, we're computing the strongly connected commponents
of the graph G.  From there, we can create a graph G' where each vertex is a
strongly connected component from G.  Then we can attack this as a source/sink
problem.

strong.c contains our main method.  All other .c and .h files are Skiena's
files upon which strong.c is dependent.  The data folder contains the test
graphs.

strong.c is run with: ./strong.c < <graphFile>
